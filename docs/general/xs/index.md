XS stands for External Subroutines and it is a custom programming language that was made by Ensamble Studios and originally used in AoM and AoEIII. Now it has been brought over to AoE2DE since [update 42848](https://www.ageofempires.com/news/aoe2de-update-42848/). An XS Script can be used in an RMS and Custom Scenarios, and it is a program that can perform calculations and execute different functions and effects.
