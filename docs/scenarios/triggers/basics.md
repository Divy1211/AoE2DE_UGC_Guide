## What are triggers, and why do we need them?

Usually a regular AoE2 game proceeds without anything about the gameplay changing in the middle of the game. Using triggers allows us to essentially introduce data mods (and much more) into the game, WHILE the game is running! This means that, for example, you could have a scenario where at the 30 minute mark, all players must pay a certain amount of resources or face some consequences. Another example is one where certain actions taken by the player can cause different events.

If you have ever played CBA (or sighed at people who play CBA) or played any of the campaigns in the game, all of them are made possible using triggers in a scenario. Another good example of just what triggers can do is this game mode [Perk Pandemonium](https://www.ageofempires.com/mods/details/19751/ "Perk Pandemonium").

Triggers introduce dynamics into a game and allow us to make interesting game modes as described above. Learning how to use triggers is simple and every map maker should be familiar with them to be able to make the best use of a scenario!

## 1. Getting Started: The UI

To work with triggers in your scenario, you need to go to the `Triggers` tab in the editor. Here, you will see two boxes to the left. The box at the top lists all the existing triggers in a scenario. When a trigger is selected, the box at the bottom displays the list of conditions and effects for that trigger.

What do the buttons under the boxes do?

1. Under the 1st box:

    1. `New`: creates a new trigger.
    2. `Copy`: After selecting a trigger, clicking this will create a new trigger that has the exact same settings, conditions and effects as the selected trigger.
    3. `Delete`: delete the selected trigger. This cannot be undone!

2. Under the 2nd box:

    1. `New Effect`: creates a new effect under the selected trigger.
    2. `New Condition`: creates a new condition under the selected trigger.
    3. `Delete`: delete the selected condition or effect. This cannot be undone!
    4. `Copy`: copy the selected condition or effect.

## Trigger Settings

When a trigger is selected, the settings related to it are displayed.
