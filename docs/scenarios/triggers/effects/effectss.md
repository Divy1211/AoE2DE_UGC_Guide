## 1. What are effects?

Effects are one of the two basic elements of triggers (the other one being Conditions). They are essentailly "cheats" in some sense, that allow you to dynamically change information in the game. Some examples of effects are `Create Unit`, `Send Chat`, `Display Instructions` and the like. To use effects,
1. Create a trigger
2. Add an effect to it.
3. Pick the effect you wish to use from the effects list.
4. Configure the settings of the effect as desired

Lets look at all the effects and their configurations one by one:
