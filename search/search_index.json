If the shot fired is not aimed at the exact centre of the target, it may still hit the target if its not off by too much since it can still land within the hitbox of the target, just not at the exact centre</p> <p>Thus, bigger targets are actually easier to hit, which explains why buildings are an easier target to hit for trebuchets than small units</p> <p></p> <p>In this image, you can see that shots that were fired in the red area in the 2<sup>nd</sup> scenario would've hit if the target had been closer like in the first scenario, but since the target is far away, they actually miss</p> <p>More technically, the visual angle of an object of the same size that is farther away is smaller, thus giving a smaller room for error for the shot in terms of the range of angles that will make the shot hit</p> <p>The chance of a unit getting converted by a monk is also determined by its accuracy</p> <p>If you modify an onager to have a big blast radius and give it a small accuracy, then attack a lot of units bunched together, the accuracy determines what percentage of units take damage from the blast of the onager! This is the reason why warwolf trebuchets get 100% accuracy because otherwise the blast wouldn't damage all of the units. Another interesting consequence of this is the delete trick with onagers and mangonels. This is where a mangonel is deleted immediately after it fires its shot and because a dead unit doesn't have an accuracy, it defaults to 100% and thus deals more damage to all the units in the blast radius</p> <p>Note: There are two other factors that play a role in determining the damage from the shot fired by the deleted mangonel</p> <ol> <li> <p>The damage from a mangonel's shot is decreased over distance when moving outward from the centre of the blast (the targeted point). However, when the mangonel is deleted, this decrease over distance doesn't happen, and the projectile deals the full 100% damage to all the units in the blast radius!</p> </li> <li> <p>A shot that is fired from lower elevation would normally deal only 75% of its normal damage due to the elevation damage reduction. deleting a mangonel in this case also makes the damage the full 100% as if there was no elevation difference</p> </li> </ol> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"general/attributes/attributes/#12-maximum-range","title":"12.

For example, if you set the hotkey ID for militia to the same value as villagers, then the hotkey for creating militia will become the same as the one used for creating villagers.</p> <p>Similarly, if you set one building's hotkey ID to the same value as another building, it will make the hotkey for the first building the same as the second building. For example, if you set the hotkey ID for stables to the same value as houses, then the hotkey for creating stables will become the same as the one used for creating houses.</p> <p>Note that the above hotkeys can be different for different players.</p> <p>However, if you set a unit's hotkey ID to a building's hotkey ID (or vice versa) it won't actually assign the expected hotkey to the unit. In this case the hotkey assigned to the unit or building is a different, fixed key, which does not change for different players. For example, setting a villager's hotkey ID to the same as a house will always make the villager use <code>Q</code> as its hotkeys.</p> <p>How do we know which key this is going to be? This key is determined by the first character of the string (the text within quotes) corresponding to the hotkey ID in the file called <code>key-value-strings-utf8.txt</code> located in this directory: <pre><code>PATH_TO_DE_FOLDER/AoE2DE/resources/en/strings/key-value/\n</code></pre> If we search for the value <code>16344</code> in this file, which is the hotkey ID of the house, it can be seen that the string corresponding to it is <code>\"Q\"</code> and its first character is <code>Q</code> which is the hotkey that is used in this case.</p> <p>In fact, we can actually use any number from this file as a hotkey ID and the hotkey set by it is determined by the first character of the corresponding string. For example, the value <code>15188</code> has the string <code>\"Gold Score\"</code> corresponding to it, and its first character is <code>G</code>. This means the value <code>15188</code> sets the key <code>G</code> as the hotkey.</p> <p>Sometimes, the numbers in this file will have strings whoes starting characters are special characters. In this case, a different hotkey (this remains the same for a particular starting character) is used. The table below contains every unique starting character present in the strings file and the key that it corresponds to.</p>"},{"location":"general/hotkeys/hotkeys/#3-first-character-of-string-id-to-hotkey-reference","title":"3.

For example, <code>10</code> is a constant. Every number is a constant.</p>"},{"location":"general/xs/beginner/#22-variables","title":"2.2. Variables","text":"<p>Variables are like boxes that are used to store constants. Variables are values that can change during the execution of the script! Think about it this way, if a variable is a box that stores a constant, that constant can be taken out and another one can be put in.  Quite literally, it is a variable (it may change!). For example, the script that we saw earlier uses 3 variables, called <code>a</code> <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>.</p> <pre><code>void main() {\n    int a = 10;\n    int b = 20;\n    int c = a+b;\n    xsChatData(\"\"+c);\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Some questions that you might have now are:</p> <ol> <li> <p>What is this <code>int</code> that preceeds the variable's name? That is the \"data type\" of the variable!</p> </li> <li> <p>What is a data type you ask? Every variable in a script has a data type, that is, it tells you what kind of value is stored in the variable. Think about it this way, if you want to store water, you need to specify that it must be stored in a bottle. Isn't that kind of obvious you might say? While to a human it might be obvious, a computer is a dumb machine. It does not know what to do unless you tell it, it is like a baby who must be spoonfed every tiny detail and instruction for it to work properly.</p> </li> <li> <p>What other types of data types are there?     There are a total of 5 data types supported by XS, they are:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Integer (<code>int</code> )</p> <p>You have seen an <code>int</code> before, an integer is a data type that stores an integer quantity. An integer quantity may be negative, positive, or zero. It never has any fractional or decimal parts (for example, an integer never has <code>0.5</code>).</p> <p>Usage: <code>int a = 10;</code> This declares a variable of type <code>int</code> called <code>a</code> with a value of <code>10</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Floating Point (<code>float</code>)</p> <p>A <code>float</code> is a data type that can store values with fractional parts or decimals. For example <code>1.5</code> is a floating point value.</p> <p>Usage: <code>float a = 3.14159;</code> This declares a variable of type <code>float</code> called <code>a</code> with a value of <code>3.14159</code></p> <p>Why would you ever use an <code>int</code> then? The reason is because computers take longer to perform calculations with floats! If you know that your calculation will not involve fractional values and decimals, you should always use an integer instead of a floating point value</p> </li> <li> <p>Boolean (<code>bool</code>)</p> <p>A <code>bool</code> is a data type, that can only store one of two different values, <code>true</code> or <code>false</code>. Any yes or no question is a boolean question in some sense, because there are only two answers, yes or no. Boolean variables are super important for conditions, which we will be looking at later.</p> <p>Usage: <code>bool a = true;</code> This declares a variable of type <code>bool</code> called <code>a</code> with a value of <code>true</code></p> <p>Note</p> <p>A value of <code>true</code> is also indicated by <code>1</code> and a value of <code>false</code> is also indicated by <code>0</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>String (<code>string</code>)</p> <p>A <code>string</code> is a word, a phrase or a sentence. A string is always enclosed by double quotes.</p> <p>Usage: <code>string a = \"this is a string! yay\";</code> This declares a variable of type <code>string</code> called <code>a</code> with a value of <code>\"this is a string! yay\"</code></p> </li> <li> <p>Vector (<code>vector</code>)</p> <p>A <code>vector</code> is a variable that can store the coordinates of a point <code>(x, y, z)</code>. If you don't know what that means, just take it as a variable that stores three different <code>float</code> values. The first value is called the \"X component\", the second value is called the \"Y component\" and the last value is called the \"Z component\".</p> <p>Usage <code>vector v = vector(1.2, 2.3, 3.2);</code> This declares a variable of type <code>vector</code> called <code>v</code> that represents a point with coordinates <code>(1.2, 2.3, 3.2)</code>.</p> </li> </ol> <p>Remember that your variable names can be almost anything! However, this does not mean that you should just use single letters or alphabets for variable names. Variable names should be chosen such that they represent, or hint to what the purpose of the variable is. Naming your variables such that they make intuitive sense is a good programming practise.</p> </li> <li> <p>How do I actually change a variable?</p> <pre><code>void main() {\n    int my_var = 20;\n\n    // you only need to specify the data type of a variable once\n    // when it is created. This \"first time\" creation is known\n    // as \"variable declaration\" or \"initialisation\".\n\n    // This way, when you change the value of the variable\n    // you don't need to say that it is an integer again\n    my_var = 30;\n\n    // you can set variables equal to each other as well.\n    int my_var2 = my_var;\n\n    // note that a variable can only be changed to another value\n    // of a similar data type. This means that this following line\n    // is WRONG:\n    my_var = \"this is a string\";\n\n    // trying to initialise a variable without a data type is also\n    // WRONG:\n\n    my_var3 = \"this string cannot be initalised since the data type is missing!\";\n\n    float my_var4 = my_var;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This process of changing the value that a variable stores is called \"assignment\".

This means that <code>a</code> and <code>A</code> are two different variable names!</p> </li> <li> <p>Variable names must not be keywords. A keyword is a reserved word in any programming language that has a special meaning! For example, <code>int</code> is a keyword in XS because it is used to declare a variable of the <code>int</code> data type.</p> </li> </ol> <p>While these are the only laws that you absolutely must follow, there are some conventions or unwritten rules that all programmers agree to follow to make their code more readable, and more clear.</p> <ol> <li> <p>When you are writing a variable name that is just one word, it is conventional to write it in all small letters. For example <code>int radius = 10;</code> or <code>string name = \"Alian713\";</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>When you are writing a variable name that consists of more than one word, then it is conventional to write it in a special case known as \"camel case\". Camel case is where the first letter of every word is capitalised except the first word. For Example: <code>float gearRatio = 2.2;</code> or <code>string firstName = \"Bruce\";</code> or <code>string lastName = \"Wayne\";</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>When you are writing a variable that is supposed to just store the value of a constant, one which you never intend to change, it is conventional to use capital letters and words are separated by underscores. For example: <code>float PI = 3.14159;</code> or <code>float GOLDEN_RATIO = 1.61803;</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>Variable names should be precise and mnemonic. That is, they should indicate to a casual programmer their purpose. Usage of single letter variable names is discouraged unless it is a throwaway or temporary variable.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"general/xs/beginner/#24-operations","title":"2.4.

It executes one set of instructions <code>if</code> a conditon is true or <code>else</code> it executes another set of instructions.</p> <p>Usage: <pre><code>void main() {\n    int a = 10;\n    int b = 20;\n    // if(boolean expression / variable / constant)\n    if(b &gt; a) {\n        // if the above condition is true do:\n        xsChatData(\"does one thing\");\n        xsChatData(\"b &gt; a confirmed!\");\n    }\n    else {\n        // if the above condition is not true do:\n        xsChatData(\"does another thing\");\n        xsChatData(\"b &lt;= a confirmed!\");\n    }\n}\n</code></pre></p> <p>Anything that is written inside curly braces <code>{}</code> is known as a \"block\" of code. A block of code written under an <code>if</code> is called the \"body\" of that <code>if</code>.</p> <p>If there is only one instruction that needs to be run inside an <code>if</code> or <code>else</code> then the curly braces <code>{}</code> can be omitted:</p> <pre><code>void main() {\n    int a = 10;\n    int b = 20;\n    if(b &gt; a)\n        xsChatData(\"does only one thing\");\n    else\n        xsChatData(\"does only another thing\");\n}\n</code></pre> <p>An <code>if</code> statement does not need to be followed by an <code>else</code> statement everytime</p> <pre><code>void main() {\n    int a = 10;\n    int b = 20;\n    if(b &gt; a)\n        xsChatData(\"doesn't do anything if the conditon is false\");\n}\n</code></pre> <p>What if you need to check multiple conditions and do separate things for each case? this is when you use an <code>if else if</code> statement!</p> <pre><code>void main() {\n    int a = 10;\n    int b = 20;\n    if(b &gt; a)\n        xsChatData(\"b &gt; 20\");\n    else if (b == 20)\n        xsChatData(\"b == 20\");\n    else\n        xsChatData(\"no condition is true\");\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Note</p> <p>In the above example, both the <code>(b &gt; a)</code> and <code>(b == 20)</code> conditions are true. However, in an <code>if else if</code> statement, only one branch of instructions is ever executed. Which condition takes proiority is decided by what order you write them in. So in this case, <code>\"b &gt; 20\"</code> will be chatted to the screen because that is the first condition which is true.</p> <p>Technically, whenever a condition becomes true and its branch of instructions are executed, all of the remaining conditions are skipped, and not even evaluated.</p> Practise <p>Now that you are armed with the power of <code>if else if</code>, can you:</p> <p>Write a script that would chat to the screen the maximum of 3 given variables.</p> <p>When you're ready, click the \"Answer\" to view the solution.</p> Answer <pre><code>void main() {\n    int a = 10;\n    int b = 20;\n    int c = 30;\n    if (a &gt; b &amp;&amp; a &gt; c)\n        xsChatData(\"the maximum is a: \"+a);\n    else if (b &gt; c &amp;&amp; b &gt; a)\n        xsChatData(\"the maximum is b: \"+b);\n    else\n        xsChatData(\"the maximum is c: \"+c)\n}\n</code></pre> </li> <li> <p>The <code>switch-case</code> statements:</p> <p>A <code>switch-case</code> is a branching structure used when you want to do several differnt things depending on the value of a variable: For example:</p> <pre><code>void main() {\n    int a = 10;\n    switch(a) {\n        case 10: {\n            xsChatData(\"if(a == 10)\");\n            xsChatData(\"do this\");\n        }\n        case 20: {\n            xsChatData(\"else if(a == 20)\");\n            xsChatData(\"do this\");\n        }\n        default : {\n            xsChatData(\"else\");\n            xsChatData(\"do this\");\n        }\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> <p>This is the same as doing: <pre><code>void main() {\n    int a = 10;\n    if (a == 10) {\n        xsChatData(\"if(a == 10)\");\n        xsChatData(\"do this\");\n    }\n    else if (a == 20) {\n        xsChatData(\"else if(a == 20)\");\n        xsChatData(\"do this\");\n    }\n    else  {\n        xsChatData(\"else\");\n        xsChatData(\"do this\");\n    }\n}\n</code></pre></p> <p>Similar to <code>if else</code>, if there is only one instruction to execute, the curly braces <code>{}</code> can be omitted:</p> <pre><code>void main() {\n    int a = 10;\n    switch(a) {\n        case 10:\n            xsChatData(\"if(a == 10) do this\");\n        case 20:\n            xsChatData(\"else if(a == 20) do this\");\n        default :\n            xsChatData(\"else do this\");\n    }\n}\n</code></pre> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"general/xs/beginner/#252-loops","title":"2.5.2.

Firstly, a <code>while</code> loop can do all that a <code>for</code> loop can. However, a <code>while</code> loop is much slower than a <code>for</code> loop in performance! If it is possible, you should always stick to using for loops! A <code>for</code> loop also takes care of increasing or decreasing the variables of iteration, which means that you cannot accidently cause an \"infinite\" loop unlike a while loop.</p>"},{"location":"general/xs/beginner/#26-modular-programming","title":"2.6.

Arrays","text":"<p>An array is a data structure that allows you to make ordered, numbered lists of one kind of data type. In every numbered list, each element is identified using its number. This number is known as an index. If <code>a</code> is an array of integers, then it might looks something like this:</p> Index Value 0 23 1 4 2 42 3 32 4 92 <p>The index is what identifies elements in an array and indices for each array always starts from 0. For example: <code>a[2]</code> is <code>42</code>. While in most programming languages <code>a[2]</code> is the way to access elements in an array, that is not how it is done in XS. Lets look at how arrays are used in XS:</p> <p>For creating arrays, the following functions are used for the relevant data type: <pre><code>// creates a sized and named integer array, with every value\n// initialised to defaultValue. returns an integer arrayID.\nint xsArrayCreateInt(int size, int defaultValue, string name)\n\n// creates a sized and named float array, with every value\n// initialised to defaultValue. returns an integer arrayID.\nint xsArrayCreateFloat(int size, float defaultValue, string name)\n\n// creates a sized and named boolean array, with every value\n// initialised to defaultValue. returns an integer arrayID.\nint xsArrayCreateBool(int size, bool defaultValue, string name)\n\n// creates a sized and named string array, with every value\n// initialised to defaultValue. returns an integer arrayID.\nint xsArrayCreateString(int size, string defaultValue, string name)\n\n// creates a sized and named vector array, with every value\n// initialised to defaultValue. returns an integer arrayID.\nint xsArrayCreateVector(int size, vector defaultValue, string name)\n</code></pre></p> <p>For the name of the array, any string may be used but all names must be unique</p> <p>All of these functions return an integer which is the ID of the array that you just created. This ID is used to perform other operations on the array. You want to store this integer in a variable that is named apty so that you can use the array later.</p> <p>Arrays are global and never go out of scope (only their IDs do). As long as an array was created and you know its ID it can be accessed within any scope. So be careful when creating arrays within rules, for loops and other iterative statements.</p> <p>To get a value at a specific index from an array, we use the following functions for the relevant data types:</p> <pre><code>// returns an integer from the specified index of the specified array\nint xsArrayGetInt(int arrayID, int index)\n\n// returns a float from the specified index of the specified array\nfloat xsArrayGetFloat(int arrayID, int index)\n\n// returns a boolean from the specified index of the specified array\nbool xsArrayGetBool(int arrayID, int index)\n\n// returns a string from the specified index of the specified array\nstring xsArrayGetString(int arrayID, int index)\n\n// returns a vector from the specified index of the specified array\nvector xsArrayGetVector(int arrayID, int index)\n</code></pre> <p>If you ever try to access values in arrays that dont exist (invalid arrayID) or values at indices that dont exist (negative indices or indices more than the length of the array) then the default values for the data types are returned. These are:</p> <pre><code>int defaultValue = -1\nfloat defaultValue = -1.0\nbool defaultValue = false\nstring defaultValue = \"\"\nvector defaultValue = vector(0, 0, 0)\n</code></pre> <p>To set a value at a specific index in an array, we use the following functions for the relevant data types:</p> <pre><code>// Sets the value at the specified index in the specified array.\nint xsArraySetInt(int arrayID, int index, int value)\n\n// Sets the value at the specified index in the specified array.\nint xsArraySetFloat(int arrayID, int index, float value)\n\n// Sets the value at the specified index in the specified array.\nint xsArraySetBool(int arrayID, int index, bool value)\n\n// Sets the value at the specified index in the specified array.\nint xsArraySetString(int arrayID, int index, string value)\n\n// Sets the value at the specified index in the specified array.\nint xsArraySetVector(int arrayID, int index, vector value)\n</code></pre> <p>Note that these Set functions return a value of <code>1</code> every time, however this does not need to be stored in a variable.</p> <p>To change the size of an array</p> <pre><code>// Resize the specified array.\nint xsArrayResizeInt(int arrayID, int newSize)\n// Resize the specified array.\nint xsArrayResizeFloat(int arrayID, int newSize)\n// Resize the specified array.\nint xsArrayResizeBool(int arrayID, int newSize)\n// Resize the specified array.\nint xsArrayResizeString(int arrayID, int newSize)\n// Resize the specified array.\nint xsArrayResizeVector(int arrayID, int newSize)\n</code></pre> <p>Note that these Resize functions return a value of <code>1</code> every time, however this does not need to be stored in a variable.</p> <p><code>int xsArrayGetSize(int arrayID)</code> is also a useful array function that returns the size of the specified array.</p>"},{"location":"general/xs/beginner/#29-type-casting","title":"2.9.

Follows same naming laws as variables.\n\n    active/inactive // this is the initial state of the rule, active means that runs by default\n                    // and inactive means that it wont run by default.\n                    // this is similar to how triggers work when you enable/disable them.\n\n    group groupName // the group that this rule belongs to. Follows same naming laws as variables.\n\n    minInterval &lt;int&gt; // the minimum time interval that must pass before the block is executed again\n    maxInterval &lt;int&gt; // the maximum time interval that may pass before the block has to be executed again\n    highFrequency   // Loop the rule 60 times every physical second (this is independant of inagme speed)\n                    // Only one of \"highFrequency\" or \"minInterval\" and \"maxInterval\" are used. Both cannot be used together\n\n    runImmediately  // It is currently unknown as to what this option does\n    priority &lt;int&gt;    // rules are executed in order of their descending priority\n{\n    // code to execute\n}\n</code></pre> <p>Example Usages:</p> <pre><code>int a = 0;\n// This rule prints the value of a every 2 seconds.\nrule chatTheValueOfA\n    active\n    minInterval 2\n    maxInterval 2\n    group chatGroup\n{\n    xsChatData(\"a = \"+a);\n    a++;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>There are a lot of built in XS functions that can interact with rules. Check the Rules Section of this guide.</p> <p>The variable <code>cActivationTime</code>, when used inside the block of a rule, gives the time of activation of the rule in seconds.</p> <p>With that, you now know everything that is currently known to work with XS Scripts. Good luck and have fun creating awesome maps!</p>"},{"location":"general/xs/constants/","title":"Constant Reference","text":"<p>Written by: Alian713</p>"},{"location":"general/xs/constants/#1-readwrite","title":"1.

Using triggers allows us to essentially introduce data mods (and much more) into the game, WHILE the game is running! This means that, for example, you could have a scenario where at the 30 minute mark, all players must pay a certain amount of resources or face some consequences. Another example is one where certain actions taken by the player can cause different events.</p> <p>If you have ever played CBA (or sighed at people who play CBA) or played any of the campaigns in the game, all of them are made possible using triggers in a scenario. Another good example of just what triggers can do is this game mode Perk Pandemonium.</p> <p>Triggers introduce dynamics into a game and allow us to make interesting game modes as described above.

Some common examples are: placing units in a grid, copying triggers for all players or creating many similar effects. These sorts of problems can easily be done using a programming language!</p> <p>It's also a perfect tool to be able to tweak your minigames or maps. Let's say you have a minigame where you get 10 gold for each unit you kill. And later you find out, it's quite over powered, so you want to change all effects to 5 gold per unit. If you used the parser to setup all triggers and effects and you had a variable like: <code>gold_per_unit = 10</code> you can just change it to 5, rerun the code and you fixed it in one go!</p> <p>The parser works by reading a scenario file, and converting it to objects in the programming language <code>Python3</code>. You can then use the functions available to easily add or change things in the scenario. A couple example functions: <code>add_unit</code>, <code>add_trigger</code>, <code>copy_trigger_per_player</code> and many, many more!</p> <p>Check out the official AoE2ScenarioParser documentation for the most up-to-date installation guide and how to get started!</p>"},{"location":"scenarios/useful_tools/parser/#python-installation","title":"Python Installation","text":"<p>For the most up-to-date installation guide, you should check out the official <code>AoE2ScenarioParser</code> docs. </p> <p>Which can be found here.</p> <p>You can install the project using pip:</p> <pre><code>pip install AoE2ScenarioParser\n</code></pre> <p>If you don't know what pip is, you can read about it in their documentation</p>"}]}
